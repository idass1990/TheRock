"""CI path filtering logic for determining whether to run CI based on modified files.

This module provides utilities to:
- Get modified file paths from git
- Filter paths based on skippable patterns (docs, markdown, etc.)
- Identify CI-related workflow files
- Decide whether CI should run based on the modified paths

Public API:
    get_git_commit_hash() - Resolve a git ref to a commit hash
    get_git_modified_paths() - Get modified files from git diff compared to worktree
    get_git_submodule_paths() - Get list of git submodule paths in the repository
    is_ci_run_required() - Check if CI run is required based on modified paths
